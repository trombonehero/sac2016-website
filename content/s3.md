## Secure and Efficient Implementation of Cryptographic Algorithms

<img src="s3-logo.png" style="float: right; margin: .5em; width: 100px;"/>

The purpose of S3 is to provide participants with an opportunity to gain
in-depth knowledge of specific areas of cryptography related to the current SAC
topics by bringing together world-class researchers who will give extended talks
of about ½ half day in their areas of specialty.
S3 is designed to create a focused learning environment that is also relaxed and
collaborative.
The SAC Summer School is open to all attendees, and may be of particular
interest to students, postdocs, and other early researchers.

S3 will take place at Memorial University from August 8--9, immediately before
SAC.
To register for S3, please visit the SAC
[registration page](https://conf.stuaff.mun.ca/getdemo.ei?id=69&s=_7AW0WQJXN).

The theme for the school this year is
"Secure and Efficient Implementation of Cryptographic Algorithms"
and will be comprised of the following talks and speakers:


### Tim Güneysu
University of Bremen & DFKI, Germany

<img src="pic_Tim.jpg" class="s3-speaker"/>
Tim Güneysu is an associate professor and head of the research group for
Computer Engineering and IT-Security (CEITS) at University of Bremen.
His group was established in corporation with the German Research Center for
Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) as part of Germany’s Excellence Initiative.
Tim’s primary research topics are in the secure design and implementation of
embedded and hardware-based systems, including aspects such as long-term secure
cryptography, lightweight and hardware-entangled cryptography.
He was a leading developer of the FPGA-based COPACOBANA cluster system that was
specifically designed for the task of cryptanalysis.
Prior to his current position, Tim was assistant professor and head of the
Hardware Security Group at the HGI at Ruhr-University Bochum.


### Patrick Longa
Microsoft Research, USA

Patrick Longa is a cryptography researcher and developer with the MSR-T Security
and Cryptography Group at
[Microsoft Research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us), in Redmond.
His research interests involve elliptic curve and pairing-based cryptography,
post-quantum cryptography, efficient algorithmic design, computer arithmetic,
high-performance implementation of cryptographic systems, and side-channel
analysis.
He is a co-designer of the elliptic curve FourQ, and has written
numerous high-performance cryptographic libraries including
[SIDH](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/sidh),
[FourQlib](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fourqlib),
[LatticeCrypto](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/latticecrypto)
and [MSR ECCLib](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/nums).
Patrick got his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the
[University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), Canada, in 2011.
During his time at Waterloo, he was also a member of the
[Centre for Applied Cryptographic Research (CACR)](http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca)
and the Laboratory for Side-Channel Security of Embedded Systems.
He was awarded with the NSERC Alexander Graham Bell Canada
Graduate Scholarship.
