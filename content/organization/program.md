|---|---|---|
| Tue, Aug 9  | evening | Welcome reception (hors d’oeuvres in the [Sheraton]({{% relref "local/accommodation.md" %}}#sheraton-hotel))
| Wed, Aug 10 | all day | Paper Sessions
| Thu, Aug 11 | morning | Paper Sessions
|             | afternoon | [Puffin/Whale Watching Tour (optional)]({{% relref "local/tour.md" %}})
|             | evening | Banquet (at [The Rooms](https://www.therooms.ca))
| Fri, Aug 12 | all day | Paper Sessions
