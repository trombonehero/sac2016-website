Authors are encouraged to submit original papers related to the following themes
for the SAC 2016 conference. Note that the first three are traditional SAC
areas, and the fourth topic is the special focus for this year.

* Design and analysis of symmetric key primitives and cryptosystems, including
  block and stream ciphers, hash functions, MAC algorithms, and authenticated
  encryption schemes.
* Efficient implementations of symmetric and public key algorithms.
* Mathematical and algorithmic aspects of applied cryptology.
* Side channel, fault and related attacks on symmetric and asymmetric
  cryptographic primitives and their countermeasures.

## Instructions for Authors

* Papers must be submitted electronically. Submission details will be given on
  the conference web site.
* Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations,
  acknowledgments, or obvious references.
* Papers should be at most 12 pages in length, excluding bibliography and
  appendices, and use single-column format, reasonable margins, and at least
  11-point fonts. Total length must not exceed 24 pages. Committee members are
  not required to read appendices, so the paper should be intelligible without
  them.
* Papers must be written in English, and begin with a title, a short abstract,
  and a list of keywords.
* The introduction should summarize the paper's contributions at a level
  appropriate for a non-specialist reader.
* Submissions should be in PDF format. As the conference proceedings will be
  published by Springer, we recommend that the submission be typeset using LaTeX
  and the LNCS style available on the Springer LNCS web site.
* If at all possible, the paper should use Type 1 (outline) fonts rather than
  Type 3 (bitmap) fonts.

Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has
published elsewhere or has submitted in parallel to a journal or any other
conference/workshop that has proceedings. The SAC Chairs reserve the right to
share information about submissions with other program committees or journal
editors to detect parallel submissions. In addition, the SAC Chairs reserve the
right to contact an author's institution/corporation and/or other appropriate
organizations if an irregular submission is detected.

Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of
their merits. Neither late submissions, submissions by email, nor hardcopy
submissions will be accepted. Submission implies the commitment of at least one
of the authors to present the paper. The SAC Chairs reserve the right to
withdraw papers from the proceedings that are not presented at the conference.
