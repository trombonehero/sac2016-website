Newfoundland is a large island, making St. John's a bit isolated,
so we recommend that SAC attendees fly directly to
[St. John's Airport (YYT)](http://stjohnsairport.com).
We are served domestically by
[Air Canada](https://www.aircanada.com),
[Porter Airlines](https://flyporter.com) and
[WestJet](https://www.westjet.com).
Internationally,
[Air Canada](https://www.aircanada.com) has a direct flight from London Heathrow
(with various Star Alliance codeshares),
[WestJet](https://www.westjet.com) flies from Dublin and London Gatwick,
[United](https://www.united.com) flies from Newark and
[American Airlines](https://www.aa.com) has WestJet codeshares from several
Canadian cities.

If you have an extra week and want to take the scenic route, you can drive to
North Sydney, NS and take a
[Marine Atlantic](http://www.marine-atlantic.ca/) ferry to Newfoundland.
The Port aux Basques ferry takes 5h to get to the Western tip of Newfoundland,
which is approximately a 12h drive from St. John's.
The Argentia ferry takes 14h to bring you to the Avalon Peninsula, a 2h drive
from St. John's.
