St. John's is a vibrant, friendly city with plenty to do in the summer.
It is North America's oldest city, having been established as a seasonal fishing
port in the 1500s, and has a somewhat quirky character of colourful (literally)
houses, historical landmarks, and stunning scenery.
We recommend taking a couple of extra days to visit.

Signal Hill, topped with the Cabot Tower, is a National Historic Site
overlooking the city and holds a special place in the history of
telecommunications as the site of Marconi's reception of the first transatlantic
wireless signal in 1901.
Nearby is Cape Spear, North America's most easterly point and home for
generations of lighthouse keepers and their families.
It is now a National Historic Site with a restored lighthouse and easy walking
trails and boardwalks around the rocky cape.

In downtown St. John's, one can stroll along the docks of the harbour front or
wander into the numerous shops along Duckworth and Water Streets where visitors
can see the creations of Newfoundland artisans specializing in silk painting,
hand-knitted sweaters, and pottery.

## Newfoundland

Newfoundland is a large rocky island off the east coast of the Canadian
mainland. Known for its rugged scenery, the down-to-earth charm of its people,
its distinctive wildlife, and its unique culture and history, Newfoundland is a
popular destination for Canadian and international tourists.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/newfoundlandlabradortourism/5146492676/in/album-72157625178658941/" title="Battle Harbour"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4007/5146492676_fb04b6727e_b.jpg" width="535" alt="Battle Harbour"></a>

The island of Newfoundland is outlined with a rugged coastline of steep cliffs
and rocky beaches. The coast's numerous bays and coves are dotted with small
communities called "outports", a few still only accessible by sea. The largely
unpopulated island interior is a mixture of trees, rocks, ponds, and bogs. Its
rugged geographical features combine to give Newfoundland some of the best
camping and hiking found anywhere. For example, on the east side of the Avalon
peninsula, the East Coast Trail winds its way past beaches, cliffs, and
seastacks, with vantage points to see whales, puffins, and bald eagles. All this
within a few minutes drive of St. John's!

For those with a few days to rent a car to explore the island, there are many
must-sees including the historical pageant of Trinity on Bonavista Bay, the bird
colonies of Cape St. Mary's, and the spectacular fjords and ancient mountains of
the island's west coast.
The really ambitious might want to visit L'Anse aux Meadows, at the very
northern tip of the island, site of the first Viking settlement in North
America.
On the way, a visit to Gros Morne National Park is well rewarded by spectacular
vistas, incredible hiking and camping without the crowds of some of Canada's
other well-known National Parks.

## Climate

Just off the coast of Newfoundland lies the point where the warm waters of the
Gulf Stream mix with the arctic waters of the Labrador Current and the result is
a climate like no other in Canada. Absolutely everything in Newfoundland - the
history, the economy, the culture, and even the humour (good humour, that is) of
the people - is influenced by the weather. Renowned for its rain (the most in
Canada), fog (the most in Canada), wind (the most in Canada), and snow (up to
20 ft in one year), Newfoundland breeds heartiness into its inhabitants.

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/newfoundlandlabradortourism/6709701131/in/album-72157625080679407/" title="Cape Race Coastline"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7014/6709701131_7d52d8ba43_b.jpg" width="535" alt="Cape Race Coastline"></a>

It would be enough to make the weak cry but somehow most Newfoundlanders seem to
be able to smile and laugh about it, predicting that, no matter how good or bad
the weather is currently, it will always get worse! Fortunately, although
summers are cool and short - usually just July and August - they are very
pleasant and experiencing the clean, fresh breezes off the ocean during this
time can be exhilarating.


## Wildlife

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/newfoundlandlabradortourism/12595989654/in/album-72157625080679407/" title="Humpback Whale Breaching at Sunset"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7406/12595989654_dbc39d5175_b.jpg" width="535" alt="Humpback Whale Breaching at Sunset"></a>

One of the great tourism draws to the island is the distinctive and accessible
wildlife that Newfoundland has to offer. Whales and seabirds can be spotted from
the shore or, for a more close-up look, numerous whale-watching boat tours are
available.  During the summer, in the southern part of the Avalon peninsula, it
is common to see caribou from North America's southern-most caribou herd
wandering leisurely across the road!

## People and culture

For centuries, most Newfoundlanders earned sustenance working in the cod
fishery. It was a hard life, food was scarce and luxuries few. Fortunately the
people were resilient and the community spirit of the outports was strong.
Today, Newfoundlanders are well known within Canada for their good cheer and
hospitality. Many people speak with a unique accent, passed down from their
Irish and English ancestors from centuries past. Be prepared to listen quickly
because Newfoundlander's speak at a very rapid pace, although they usually slow
down for "CFAs" (def. come-from-aways) or "mainlanders" (def. anyone not from
Newfoundland).

<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/newfoundlandlabradortourism/5146266004/in/album-72157631499118056/" title="Tattoo Re-Enactment on Signal Hill"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1438/5146266004_033d04115b_b.jpg" width="535" alt="Tattoo Re-Enactment on Signal Hill"></a>

The primarily English and Irish roots of Newfoundland's first European settlers
are the foundation of its cultural heritage. However, centuries of life in
isolated, hardworking outport fishing communities have permuted Newfoundland
into its own unique cultural identity. Certainly, like nothing seen elsewhere in
the western hemisphere, Newfoundland culture is steeped in folklore, typically
preserved through its English and Celtic folk music traditions. Today, many
Newfoundland musicians continue to perform this traditional music, some, having
successfully fused it with more modern pop culture, have received national and
international success.
