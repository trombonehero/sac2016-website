Do you need a visa?
: Check with
  [Citizenship and Immigration Canada](https://cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp)
  --- citizens of many countries do not require a visa for a brief visit.

How do I apply?
: CIC has a
  ["Come to Canada" wizard](https://cic.gc.ca/ctc-vac/cometocanada.asp)
  to help you find the correct visa application.

What if I need a letter of invitation?
